            <h2>//Personal profile</h2>
            <p>I am currently a student studying <strong>Computer Science</strong> at Teesside University with a predicted <strong>
            1st class degree.</strong> I have industry experience in the form of a <strong>placement year</strong> working as a 
            software developer at Accenture. My University modules have helped me develop strong problem solving skills as well as 
            gaining significant technical experience with different software and technologies. My previous work experience has 
            equipped me with an excellent attention to detail along with great organisational skills.</p>
            <h2>//Skills and technologies</h2>
            <p>I've worked on various projects both at <strong>University</strong> and in <strong>industry</strong>. I am always 
            looking to expand my existing skill set which includes some of the following technologies:</p>

            <h2>//Education</h2>
            <p>I studied for my <strong>A-Levels</strong> in <strong>graphic design</strong> and <strong>double award IT</strong> at 
            Queen Elizabeth sixth form collage from 2013 to 2015. I then moved to <strong>Teesside University</strong>
            to study <strong>Computer Science with a placement year</strong> from 2015 to 2019.

            <h2>//Employment</h2>
                <p><strong>June 2017 – August 2018: Accenture <br>
                Software Developer</strong><br>
                For my placement year at University I joined Accenture as a software developer. Upon joining I completed many 
                kinds of training in both technical development skills and soft skills. I spent my placement within an award-winning 
                team specialising in robotic process automation for the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). During my time on 
                this team, I have demonstrated my skills working in an agile development environment and have successfully taken 
                multiple RPA products to production in addition to a machine learning solution to help increase success rates of 
                one process from 45% to 90% and over. The technology I worked with on a regular basis included C# and VB.NET. I 
                also used Python, C++ and HTML/CSS in other projects throughout the year. 
                </p>
                <p><strong>August 2016 - September 2016: North Yorkshire County Council<br>
                IT Undergraduate Placement</strong><br>
                I joined North Yorkshire County Council on a 6-week internship as part of their 2020 program. There, I was tasked 
                with working as part of a team to set up new machines for employees at NYCC. As part of this process I attended 
                rollout sessions where I was tasked with handing out the new equipment to the end user and explaining to the user 
                how to use the equipment effectively. I was also tasked with fixing hardware issues and taking a company car to 
                deliver new equipment to external offices. 
                </p>
                <p><strong>June 2011 – June 2015: Leyburn Bikes<br>
                Shop Keeper and Cycle Mechanic</strong><br>
                Working at Leyburn Bikes provided me with a variety of responsibilities, including: opening and closing the premises. 
                As a contrast to my work at the Bolton Arms and Three Horseshoes, much of my time at Leyburn bikes was spent working 
                independently, carrying out tasks such as equipping customers with specialist information regarding bicycle components 
                and complete cycles to purchase, and working on customers’ cycles including full services to brake pad replacements.
